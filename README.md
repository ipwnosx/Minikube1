 Q. Does Minikube requires docker?
  Minikube creates a Virtual Machine that includes Kubernetes and a Docker daemon. When Kubernetes attempts to schedule containers using Docker, the Docker daemon may require external network access to pull containers. If you are behind an HTTP proxy, you may need to supply Docker with the proxy settings.
